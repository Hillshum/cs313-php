1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:

Well, there's a page.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

The assignments page isn't up yet.


5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

Uhh...Bootstrap menus are pretty helpful.

6. What is the difference between an HTTP Get and Post? When should each be used?
Maybe I just skipped half the reading, but I don't remember it. Anyway, I happen to know that a get is used for reading content and has query parameters in the form `?foo=bar&fixstuff=true`, while a post has the parameters elsewhere and is usually used for writing stuff or something that would make a change.


7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


D

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

It does what it should.
